# Food Truck Project

## Details
This AWESOME Food Truck application allows you to enter in Food Trucks of 
your choice with the max of five Food Trucks. 

It allows you to choose from a menu of 4 options, those options include: 

- List of all existing Food Trucks
- See the average of Food Trucks
- Display the highest-rated Food Truck
- Quit the program


The Food Trucks also include a unique ID which the user cannot see until they
get a display of the Food Trucks.

## What I learned

I also learned the importance of
static and non-static methods/variables.

Examples that helped solidify these concepts:

- The Food Truck ID allocation 
- Using just one static main method


Doing this project really helped me understand back-end and front-end properties. 
I learned how useful class encapsulation can be. 
It is especially useful when you have
many instances of the same object that need to be saved into memory.

To keep the code DRY, I can just call the Food Truck class constructor in my 
Food Truck Application class to set those specific properties.


## Technologies I used

Java, Eclipse, and Git
